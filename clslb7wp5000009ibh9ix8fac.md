1) Filtration -> Insoluble solid from liquid.

  

2) Evaporation -> Soluble solid from liquid.

  

3) Simple Distillation -> Single liquid from soluble solid.

  

4) Separating Funnel -> Two or more immiscible liquid from mixture.

  

5) Fractional Distillation -> Two or more liquids from mixture.

  

6) Substitution / Electrolysis -> Separation of metal from compound.

  

7) Chromatography -> Separation of colours.
