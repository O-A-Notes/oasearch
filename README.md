## How to add your url

go to the file search.js and copy this format and paste into the code

```js
{
value: "Your website or page name",
url: "your url",
icon: '<i class=ti-world title="Website"></i>',
type: "website"
},
```

### Alternate

```js
{
value: "Your website or page name",
url: "your url",
},
```

And then pull request and we will verify the url and after verifying we will approve it.
